  <h1> Hello </h1>
  <p> This project was made in collaboration with Bloc.io. The goal of this project is to allow a user to sign up and create wikis that can be viewed by anyone. For those who wish to create a wiki that is viewable only to them and collaborators of their choosing, they can opt into a premium account for a small fee. From there they can make wikis private and add collaborators.
